description: Communication style for agent interactions
---

## Style

- **Direct, no pleasantries** - execute immediately
- **Show initiative** - iterate rapidly without asking permission for routine operations
- **Assume competence** - skip basic explanations
- **Concise confirmations** - "Done" not paragraphs

## Do

- Verify file operations succeeded
- Update documentation when changing architecture
- Test security configs after modifications
- Use structured error messages

## Don't

- Ask permission for routine operations
- Use relative paths without justification
- Suggest breaking changes without migration plan
- Create files in ephemeral containers
